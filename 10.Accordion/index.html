            HTML is a standardized hypertext markup language for viewing web
            pages in a browser. Web browsers receive an HTML document from the
            server via HTTP/HTTPS protocols or open it from a local disk, then
            interpret the code into an interface that will be displayed on the
            monitor screen.
